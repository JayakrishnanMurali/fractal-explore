## User Experience Requirements

### Core User Journeys

#### Journey 1: First-Time Setup
1. Developer runs single command: `npx create-component-explorer`
2. Tool auto-detects framework and components
3. Development server starts with components loaded
4. Developer sees interactive component catalog

**Success Criteria**: Complete setup in <2 minutes

#### Journey 2: Daily Development
1. Developer makes component changes
2. Changes reflect instantly in the explorer
3. Documentation updates automatically
4. Testing provides immediate feedback
